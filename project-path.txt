Step 1: Data Collection

To start my project, the first thing I need to do is get a movie dataset. I'll search websites like IMDb
or Kaggle to find data sets that include information about the movie title, genre, rating, release year,
box office receipts, and other relevant details.

Step 2: Data Preparation and Cleaning

Once you have obtained the dataset, use the Pandas library to load it into a DataFrame. With this, I will be able to make a
initial exploration of the data and become familiar with its structure and content.
At this stage, I'll make sure to clean up the data properly.
I will address missing values and remove any duplicates that may affect analysis and results.

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

With the data cleaned and prepared, I will use Pandas and Matplotlib to carry out the exploratory analysis.
I'll count the number of movies in each genre to get an overview of distributions.
In addition, I will calculate qualification statistics to better understand the range and dispersion of pressures.
Also, I'll explore trends over time, looking at how movies have evolved by year of release.

Step 4: Data Visualization

I'll take advantage of the Matplotlib library to create attractive plots showing the results of the exploratory analysis.
For example, create a bar chart to present the number of movies by genre,
a line graph to follow the evolution of the lesions over the years, and a scatter plot
to visualize the possible relationship between rating and box office collection.

Step 5: Predictive Modeling (optional)

If I decide to take the project to a more advanced level, I will use the Scikit-learn library to build a regression model that will
Allow to predict movie box office taking based on other characteristics. However, this stage is optional and I can
skip it if you prefer to keep the most basic project.

Step 6: Interactive visualization with Tableau

Once I've made the visualizations static with Matplotlib, I'll take my results to a more interactive level using Tableau.
I will import the clean data into Tableau and create interactive dashboards that allow users to explore the information dynamically.
This will enrich the user experience and make it easier to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Step 7: Report and Presentation

The last step will be to create a report that summarizes my results and highlights the most interesting visualizations.
I will prepare a presentation to share my results with others and explain my key findings.
I will make sure to use the power of Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib to do effective analysis and visualization of the data,
and I will use Tableau to create engaging and interactive visualizations that highlight the results of my project.

In this project, I will pay close attention to detail at each step, interpret the data correctly, and present the results clearly and effectively.
I hope this Film Data Analysis and Visualization project is successful and enriching!
